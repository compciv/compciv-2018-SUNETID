# The Demo repo for CompCiv-2018 homework


Note that this repo is not meant to be the **answer** repo, but an example repo for students to follow. I wouldn't use any of this code unless you're explicitly told to in class...

The tentative home repo for compciv-2018 homework is:

https://github.com/compciv/homeworkhome

> Need a `.gitignore` for your repo? You can find it at the [compciv/stash repo](https://github.com/compciv/stash/blob/master/configs/compciv.gitignore)
